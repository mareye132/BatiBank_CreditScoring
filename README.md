# BatiBank_CreditScoring
BatiBank Credit Scoring is a machine learning project aimed at developing a model to predict creditworthiness based on customer data. The project follows a modular development approach, with specific tasks and branches designated for various stages of the development process.

Tasks and Branches
Task-2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Branch: task-2

The EDA task explores the dataset to gain insights and understand the data distribution, correlations, and patterns. Activities include:

Visualizing the data using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
Calculating summary statistics and correlations.
Identifying outliers and anomalies.
Preparing visualization reports using Jupyter Notebooks.
Task-3: Feature Engineering
Branch: task-3

In this task, various techniques are applied to prepare and enhance the dataset for better model performance. Activities include:

Creating new features based on existing data.
Encoding categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.
Normalizing or scaling numerical features.
Selecting relevant features to reduce dimensionality.
Task-4: Model Development
Branch: task-4

This task focuses on developing and training machine learning models to predict credit scores. Activities include:

Training models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Implementing cross-validation to optimize model parameters.Storing model files and training scripts in the scripts/ directory.
Task-5: Model Deployment
Branch: task-5

In the final task, the model is deployed using a web interface built with Streamlit. Activities include:

Developing a Flask API for the model prediction endpoint.
Building a Streamlit dashboard to display insights and make predictions.
Setting up Docker containers for deployment.
