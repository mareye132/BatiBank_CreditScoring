🏦 BatiBank_CreditScoring
BatiBank Credit Scoring is a machine learning project aimed at developing a model to predict creditworthiness based on customer data. The project follows a modular development approach, with specific tasks and branches designated for various stages of the development process.

🔍 Tasks and Branches
Task-2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Branch: task-2

The EDA task explores the dataset to gain insights and understand the data distribution, correlations, and patterns. Activities include:

📊 Visualizing the data using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
📈 Calculating summary statistics and correlations.
🔍 Identifying outliers and anomalies.
📝 Preparing visualization reports using Jupyter Notebooks.
Task-3: Feature Engineering
Branch: task-3

In this task, various techniques are applied to prepare and enhance the dataset for better model performance. Activities include:

🧩 Creating new features based on existing data.
🔠 Encoding categorical variables with One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.
📏 Normalizing or scaling numerical features.
🔍 Selecting relevant features to reduce dimensionality.
Task-4: Model Development
Branch: task-4

This task focuses on developing and training machine learning models to predict credit scores. Activities include:

🧠 Training models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
🔧 Implementing cross-validation to optimize model parameters.
📂 Storing model files and training scripts in the scripts/ directory.
Task-5: Model Deployment
Branch: task-5

In the final task, the model is deployed with a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit. Activities include:

🌐 Developing a Flask API for the model prediction endpoint.
📊 Building a Streamlit dashboard to display insights and make predictions.
🐳 Setting up Docker containers for deployment.
